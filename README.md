# 1.Calculate List Median

The implementation made in the Python files:
1. median.py has the logic implementation of the list operations.
2. test_calculate_median.py contains unit tests for median values.
3. median_ui.py contains the user interaction logic for the solution.

The logic has been developed:
1. Calculating the median just when a value is added to the list
2. Divided in 4 cases:
   a. When the list is empty
   b. When the list has one element
   c. When length is even
   d. When length is odd
   
3. The method calculate_median in median.py is the core method. Other functions and methods have been created for support and to keep code
as clean as possible: short methods and code readable.
