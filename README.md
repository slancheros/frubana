# 1.Calculate List Median

The implementation made in the Python files:
1. median.py has the logic implementation of the list operations.
2. test_calculate_median.py contains unit tests for median values.
3. median_ui.py contains the user interaction logic for the solution.

The logic has been developed:
1. Calculating the median just when a value is added to the list
2. Divided in 4 cases:
   1. When the list is empty
   2. When the list has one element
   3. When length is even
   4. When length is odd
   
3. The method calculate_median in median.py is the core method. Other functions and methods have been created for support and to keep code
as clean as possible: short methods and code readable.

4. Some input validation is provided, and prompts for input  have been added. The output is as specified on the requirement.

5. It took approx. **2 hours and a half** to complete in effective time.
